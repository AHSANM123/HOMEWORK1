            <h1>INTRODUCTION </h1> 
            <p>Data, in my opinion, tells us more than simply numbers. It helps us understand our people and what they want. I want to study data science because I want the company to make the most of its data. I have 3 months of data analytics experience. I began my career as a electrical engineer. By becoming qualified, I was able to make the transition to data analysis. I am now proficient in SQL and Java, and I'm learning Python.</p>
